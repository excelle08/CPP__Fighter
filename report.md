# C++ Game Fighter experiment report

## Product Introduction
### Target User
This is a single-user game intended for people who are idle to kill time
### Features
1. Normal mode
2. Infinite mode where there is no life point limit.
### Game rules
1. Move your plane with direction keys
2. Press Space key to launch (blue) bombs, the frequency of bomb outputting increases as your level goes up. Every bomb costs you 5 points.
3. Enemies fly down at a certain velocity, and the generation rates and flying speeds increases as your level goes up.
4. Use bombs to hit enemies. You earn 20 points for each hit enemy plane, but you lose `10*level` points for every missed enemy.
5. Your level goes up every time earning 500 points, but it can also go down on points loss.
6. Enemies would output (red) bombs randomly after level 2.
7. Bombs generated by enemies simply fly down before level 6, after that they will fly towards the plane.
8. Avoid these bombs. If your plane gets hit, you will receive 5 life points down.
9. If your life points or score goes to zero, you lose. Press R to replay or Q to exit.
10. Super enemy would be generated every 20 seconds, flying down slowly.
11. Super enemy has 20 life points, and you have to hit several times to kill it. It will also randomly launch bombs towards your plane.
12. Life points bonus will be generated every 9 seconds. If you get to hit it, you get 5 extra life points.

## Program structure
### Development environment
Operating system: `OS X 10.10.3`

Complier: `Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.53)`

Graphics library: `SFML 2.3`

Development tools: `Sublime Text 2`

### Building procedure
#### Install dependencies
1. Download and unpack the SFML library consistent with your compiling environment(For experiment environment is Mac OS X)
2. Copy files to the correspoinding library directories
3. If you intend to use IDE, you may need to config your IDE in reference to the tutorial on SFML official website.

#### Compile in terminal
Open your terminal, go to this diretory and use `make` to compile the source code.

Normally compiler would output a executable called `main`, just run it.
### Modules
#### Classes
1. Stage       - The game stage
2. Background  - Background image and music
3. Bomb        - Bombs
4. BonusLife   - Bonus for life points
5. Enemy       - Enemies (Normal ones)
6. MyObject    - A basic class for all entities

### Performance
The game usually runs at a stable framerate about 60, and there is no apparent lagging.

The single output executable file `main` is 129K, with all resources will take 2.2 MB.

All source code adds up to 1,287 lines.
